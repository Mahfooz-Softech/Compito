# Worker Account Deactivation System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The worker account deactivation system has been fully implemented to automatically deactivate worker accounts that meet specific criteria and provide admin management capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema & Functions
- **Tables**: `worker_account_status`, `account_activation_requests`
- **Functions**: 
  - `check_worker_deactivation()` - Triggers on worker profile updates
  - `handle_account_reactivation()` - Processes reactivation requests
  - `check_all_starter_workers()` - Comprehensive check for existing workers
  - `run_periodic_deactivation_check()` - Runs the comprehensive check
  - `can_worker_perform_action()` - RLS policy helper function
- **Views**: `admin_worker_accounts` - Admin dashboard view
- **Triggers**: Automatic deactivation checks and reactivation handling

### 2. React Components
- **`AccountStatusBanner.tsx`** - Shows worker their account status and allows reactivation requests
- **`WorkerRouteProtection.tsx`** - HOC that prevents deactivated workers from accessing protected routes
- **`WorkerAccountManagement.tsx`** - Admin page to manage worker accounts
- **`AccountActivationRequests.tsx`** - Admin interface for reactivation requests
- **`AccountActivationDashboard.tsx`** - Admin dashboard widget for account management

### 3. Custom Hooks
- **`useWorkerAccountStatus`** - Worker-side account status management
- **`useAdminAccountActivation`** - Admin-side account activation management

### 4. Routing & Navigation
- Added `/admin/worker-accounts` route for admin access
- Added "Worker Accounts" link in admin sidebar navigation
- Integrated with existing admin dashboard structure

## How It Works

### Automatic Deactivation Criteria
A worker account is automatically deactivated when:
1. **Category**: Worker is in "Starter" category
2. **Age**: Account is 3+ months old
3. **Customers**: Has 0 unique customers from completed bookings

### Deactivation Process
1. **Trigger**: Fires when `worker_profiles` table is updated
2. **Check**: Function evaluates deactivation criteria
3. **Action**: If criteria met, account is marked as inactive
4. **Notification**: Worker and admin receive deactivation notifications
5. **Restriction**: RLS policies prevent deactivated workers from performing actions

### Reactivation Process
1. **Request**: Deactivated worker submits reactivation request
2. **Review**: Admin reviews the request in admin panel
3. **Decision**: Admin approves or rejects the request
4. **Action**: If approved, account is reactivated
5. **Notification**: Both worker and admin receive notifications

## Testing the System

### 1. Apply the Migration
Run the migration file `supabase/migrations/20250819000001_fix_worker_deactivation.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor.

### 2. Run the Test Script
Use the `test_worker_deactivation.sql` file to verify all components are working:
- Check if tables and functions exist
- Verify worker account statuses
- Test deactivation functions
- Check RLS policies
- Verify notifications

### 3. Manual Testing
- **Worker Side**: Check if deactivated workers see the status banner
- **Admin Side**: Navigate to `/admin/worker-accounts` to see the management interface
- **Functionality**: Test manual deactivation/reactivation of accounts

## Expected Results

### After Migration
1. **Existing Workers**: Workers who meet deactivation criteria should be automatically deactivated
2. **Admin View**: `/admin/worker-accounts` should show all worker statuses
3. **Notifications**: Deactivation notifications should be sent to workers and admins
4. **RLS Policies**: Deactivated workers should be unable to perform restricted actions

### Admin Panel Features
- **Statistics**: Total workers, active, deactivated, high-risk counts
- **Filtering**: View all, active, or deactivated workers
- **Risk Assessment**: Visual indicators for workers approaching deactivation
- **Manual Actions**: Ability to manually deactivate/reactivate accounts
- **Periodic Checks**: Button to run manual deactivation checks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Workers Not Deactivated**: Run `SELECT public.run_periodic_deactivation_check();`
2. **Missing Functions**: Ensure migration was applied completely
3. **RLS Policy Errors**: Check if `can_worker_perform_action` function exists
4. **View Errors**: Verify `admin_worker_accounts` view was created

### Debug Queries
```sql
-- Check worker account statuses
SELECT * FROM public.worker_account_status;

-- Check for workers meeting deactivation criteria
SELECT * FROM public.check_all_starter_workers();

-- Verify RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename IN ('service_requests', 'bookings', 'offers', 'messages');
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Apply the migration in Supabase
2. Run the test script to verify functionality
3. Check if existing workers are properly deactivated

### Future Enhancements
1. **Automated Scheduling**: Set up cron jobs for periodic checks
2. **Email Notifications**: Send email alerts for deactivations
3. **Analytics**: Track deactivation patterns and trends
4. **Customization**: Allow admins to configure deactivation criteria

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/pages/admin/WorkerAccountManagement.tsx`
- `src/components/worker/AccountStatusBanner.tsx`
- `src/components/worker/WorkerRouteProtection.tsx`
- `src/components/admin/AccountActivationRequests.tsx`
- `src/components/admin/AccountActivationDashboard.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useWorkerAccountStatus.ts`
- `src/hooks/useAdminAccountActivation.ts`
- `supabase/migrations/20250819000001_fix_worker_deactivation.sql`
- `test_worker_deactivation.sql`

### Modified Files
- `src/App.tsx` - Added new admin route
- `src/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx` - Added navigation link
- `src/components/dashboard/DashboardLayout.tsx` - Added dropdown menu

## Security Considerations

1. **RLS Policies**: All worker actions are protected by RLS policies
2. **Admin Only**: Account management is restricted to admin users
3. **Audit Trail**: All deactivation/reactivation actions are logged
4. **Notification System**: Transparent communication about account status changes

## Performance Notes

1. **Triggers**: Deactivation checks only run when worker profiles are updated
2. **Periodic Checks**: Manual function available for comprehensive checks
3. **Indexing**: Consider adding indexes on `created_at` and `status` columns for large datasets
4. **Caching**: Worker account status is cached in React state to minimize database calls

The system is now ready for testing and should automatically handle worker account deactivation based on the specified criteria.
